"""
Interactively renames image files in a specified directory based on user input.

This script scans a directory for image files matching the pattern
'set-card-game-real-\d+-\d.jpg'. For each matching file, it displays the
image and prompts the user in the terminal for a new suffix. The script then
renames the file, replacing the last number with the user's input.

Usage:
    python rename_extracted_cards.py <path_to_your_image_directory>
